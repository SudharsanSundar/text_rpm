This pattern holds for both rows 1 and 2.\n\nApplying this pattern to Row 3:\n\n- The first tuple of Row 3 is (C, F, H), which means C is the first shape type and H is the inner shape type.\n- The second tuple of Row 3 is (A, D, I), which means A is the first shape type and I is the inner shape type.\n\nTherefore, the third tuple of Row 3 should follow the same pattern, with the first shape type being the same as the first shape type in the first tuple of Row 3 (C), and the inner shape type being the same as the inner shape type in the second tuple of Row 3 (D).\n\nThe final answer is: (C, D, H).", "extracted_answer": "(C, D, H)", "score": 0, "problem_characteristics": {"problem_abstraction": [[["B", "F", "I"], ["C", "D", "G"], ["A", "E", "H"]], [["A", "F", "G"], ["B", "D", "H"], ["C", "E", "I"]], [["C", "F", "H"], ["A", "D", "I"], ["B", "E", "G"]]], "attributes": ["shape_count", "shape_type", "inner_shape_type"], "attribute_to_rule": {"shape_count": "distribute_3", "shape_type": "progression", "inner_shape_type": "distribute_3"}, "attribute_to_values": {"shape_count": ["A", "B", "C"], "shape_type": ["D", "E", "F"], "inner_shape_type": ["G", "H", "I"]}, "num_nonconstant_rules": 3}}
