Let's analyze the pattern:\n\nRow 1: (L, F, I), (K, D, H), (J, E, G)\nRow 2: (K, E, I), (J, F, H), (L, D, G)\n\nWe can see that each row has three tuples, and each tuple consists of three elements: shape type, inner shape orientation, and inner shape type. The elements in each tuple are always in the same order.\n\nNow, let's look at the third row:\n\nRow 3: (J, D, I), (L, E, H), (?, ?, ?)\n\nThe first two tuples are consistent with the pattern, but the last tuple is missing two elements. Let's try to fill in the missing elements based on the pattern:\n\nIf the pattern continues, the last tuple should have the same shape type as the first tuple in the row, which is (J, D, I). So, the first element of the last tuple should be \"J\".\n\nThe second element of the last tuple should be the inner shape orientation, which is consistent with the pattern. The second tuple in the row has \"E\" as the inner shape orientation, so the second element of the last tuple should be \"E\".\n\nFinally, the third element of the last tuple should be the inner shape type, which is consistent with the pattern. The third tuple in the row has \"G\" as the inner shape type, so the third element of the last tuple should be \"G\".\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe final answer is: (J, E, G)", "extracted_answer": "(J, E, G)", "score": 0, "problem_characteristics": {"problem_abstraction": [[["L", "F", "I"], ["K", "D", "H"], ["J", "E", "G"]], [["K", "E", "I"], ["J", "F", "H"], ["L", "D", "G"]], [["J", "D", "I"], ["L", "E", "H"], ["K", "F", "G"]]], "attributes": ["shape_type", "inner_shape_orientation", "inner_shape_type"], "attribute_to_rule": {"shape_type": "distribute_3", "inner_shape_orientation": "distribute_3", "inner_shape_type": "progression"}, "attribute_to_values": {"shape_type": ["J", "K", "L"], "inner_shape_orientation": ["D", "E", "F"], "inner_shape_type": ["G", "H", "I"]}, "num_nonconstant_rules": 3}}
