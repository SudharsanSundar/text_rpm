The pattern consists of five tuples, each representing a different inner shape, shape texture, shape color, inner shape type, and shape type.\n\nThe first two rows provide examples of how the tuples are arranged. The first tuple in Row 1 is (B, E, I, J, N), which corresponds to a blue, egg-shaped inner shape with a shiny texture, a light blue color, and a jellyfish-like inner shape type (I), and a normal shape type (N). The second tuple in Row 1 is (C, E, I, L, O), which is a cyan, egg-shaped inner shape with a shiny texture, a light cyan color, and a jellyfish-like inner shape type (I), and a normal shape type (N). The first tuple in Row 2 is (A, E, I, K, M), which is a red, egg-shaped inner shape with a shiny texture, a light red color, and a jellyfish-like inner shape type (I), and a normal shape type (N). The second tuple in Row 2 is (B, D, H, J, O), which is a blue, diamond-shaped inner shape with a shiny texture, a dark blue color, and a jellyfish-like inner shape type (I), and a normal shape type (N).\n\nBased on this pattern, we can infer that the third tuple in Row 3 should be a combination of a different inner shape, a different shape texture, a different shape color, a different inner shape type, and a different shape type.

The pattern consists of five tuples, each representing a shape and its position, orientation, and type.\n\nWe can observe the following relationships in the pattern:\n\n1. The first letter of each tuple corresponds to the shape type (C, B, A, C, B).\n2. The second letter of each tuple corresponds to the shape position (F, E, D, G, H).\n3. The third letter of each tuple corresponds to the inner shape orientation (J, K, L, M, N).\n4. The fourth letter of each tuple corresponds to the inner shape type (I, H, G, F, E).\n5. The fifth letter of each tuple corresponds to the inner shape position (O, M, L, N, O).\n\nBased on these relationships, we can infer the following:\n\n- The first tuple in Row 3 should have a shape type of \"G\" (since the pattern starts with \"G\" and then alternates between \"C\" and \"B\").\n- The second tuple in Row 3 should have a shape type of \"H\" (since the pattern alternates between \"G\" and \"H\").\n- The third tuple in Row 3 should have a shape type of \"I\" (since the pattern alternates between \"H\" and \"I\").\n\nNow, let's fill in the remaining positions:\n\n- The first position of the third tuple should be \"A\" (since the pattern starts with \"A\" and then alternates between \"D\" and \"A\").\n- The second position of the third tuple should be \"B\" (since the pattern alternates between \"A\" and \"B\").\n- The third position of the third tuple should be \"C\" (since the pattern alternates between \"B\" and \"C\").\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\n[\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"I\", \"O\"].", "extracted_answer": "(O, M, L, N, O)", "score": 0, "problem_characteristics": {"problem_abstraction": [[["C", "F", "H", "J", "N"], ["B", "E", "I", "K", "O"], ["A", "D", "G", "L", "M"]], [["C", "F", "G", "J", "N"], ["B", "E", "H", "K", "O"], ["A", "D", "I", "L", "M"]], [["C", "F", "I", "J", "N"], ["B", "E", "G", "K", "O"], ["A", "D", "H", "L", "M"]]], "attributes": ["shape_position", "shape_type", "inner_shape_orientation", "inner_shape_type", "inner_shape_position"], "attribute_to_rule": {"shape_position": "progression", "shape_type": "progression", "inner_shape_orientation": "distribute_3", "inner_shape_type": "progression", "inner_shape_position": "progression"}, "attribute_to_values": {"shape_position": ["A", "B", "C"], "shape_type": ["D", "E", "F"], "inner_shape_orientation": ["G", "H", "I"], "inner_shape_type": ["J", "K", "L"], "inner_shape_position": ["M", "N", "O"]}, "num_nonconstant_rules": 5}}
