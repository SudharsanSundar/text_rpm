Column 3 (D, E, ?) follows the pattern of Column 2, so when shape C appears in the third column, the size should increase by 2 compared to the size of the second column (E to F + 2).\n\nNow, let's find the size for the second shape in the third row:\n- The first shape in the third row is C, which corresponds to size E in the first column.\n- To find the size for the second shape in the third row, we need to find the size that is 2 greater than the size of the second shape in the second row (E). So, the size for the second shape in the third row is E + 2, which equals G.\n\nNow, let's find the shape for the second shape in the third row:\n- The second shape in the third row should follow the pattern of Column 2, which means it should be the shape that corresponds to size F + 2 in Column 2.\n- In Column 2, shape A corresponds to size D, shape B corresponds to size E, and there is no shape that corresponds to size F + 2. However, since the pattern seems to be cyclic (A, B, C, A, B, C, ...), we can assume that shape A corresponds to size F + 2 as well.\n\nThe final answer is: (A, G)", "extracted_answer": "(A, G)", "score": 0, "problem_characteristics": {"problem_abstraction": [[["C", "D"], ["A", "D"], ["B", "D"]], [["A", "E"], ["B", "E"], ["C", "E"]], [["B", "F"], ["C", "F"], ["A", "F"]]], "attributes": ["shape_type", "shape_size"], "attribute_to_rule": {"shape_type": "distribute_3", "shape_size": "constant"}, "attribute_to_values": {"shape_type": ["A", "B", "C"], "shape_size": ["D", "E", "F"]}, "num_nonconstant_rules": 1}}

Again, the fourth element (shape type) is the same (K) for all three tuples. So, it seems that the fourth element (shape type) doesn't depend on the third element (shape count) either.\n\nSince the pattern doesn't seem to depend on the shape count, let's check if there's a pattern with the first three elements:\n- For the first row, the first three elements are (B, D, I) in the first tuple, (B, E, H) in the second tuple, and (B, F, G) in the third tuple.
