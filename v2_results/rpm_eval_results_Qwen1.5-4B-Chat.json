From Row 1 to Row 3, we can see that the shape textures (F, D, E) and shapes (I, S, U) are repeated, while the shape positions (R, P, Q) are also repeated. Additionally, the shape types (B, C, A) and orientations (O, M, N) are not repeated in any of the rows.\nTherefore, based on these observations, we can assume that the final tuple of Row 3 will have a shape texture of F, shape position of P, shape type of B, and orientation of O. However, since there are no other clues provided, we cannot be certain about the shape count, shape type, shape orientation, shape position, and inner shape type.\nTherefore, the final answer is: The final answer is: (F, P, B, O, ?, ?, ?).", "extracted_answer": "(F, P, B, O, ?, ?, ?)", "score": 0, "problem_characteristics": {"problem_abstraction": [[["B", "F", "I", "S", "O", "R", "V"], ["C", "F", "G", "T", "O", "Q", "X"], ["A", "F", "H", "U", "O", "P", "W"]], [["B", "D", "I", "S", "M", "P", "V"], ["C", "D", "G", "T", "M", "R", "X"], ["A", "D", "H", "U", "M", "Q", "W"]], [["B", "E", "I", "S", "N", "Q", "V"], ["C", "E", "G", "T", "N", "P", "X"], ["A", "E", "H", "U", "N", "R", "W"]]], "attributes": ["inner_shape_position", "shape_texture", "shape_count", "shape_type", "shape_orientation", "shape_position", "inner_shape_type"], "attribute_to_rule": {"inner_shape_position": "progression", "shape_texture": "constant", "shape_count": "progression", "shape_type": "progression", "shape_orientation": "constant", "shape_position": "distribute_3", "inner_shape_type": "progression"}, "attribute_to_values": {"inner_shape_position": ["A", "B", "C"], "shape_texture": ["D", "E", "F"], "shape_count": ["G", "H", "I"], "shape_type": ["S", "T", "U"], "shape_orientation": ["M", "N", "O"], "shape_position": ["P", "Q", "R"], "inner_shape_type": ["V", "W", "X"]}, "num_nonconstant_rules": 5}}
