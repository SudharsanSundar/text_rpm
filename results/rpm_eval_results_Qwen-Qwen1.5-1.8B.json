The function should have a time complexity of O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the original list and m is the maximum value in the original list.\n\nAssistant: Here is a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_prime_numbers(numbers):\n    primes = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            primes.append(num)\n    return primes\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. If it is divisible by any number, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.\n- The `get_prime_numbers` function takes in a list of numbers and initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.\n- It then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.\n- For each number, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if it is prime.\n- If the number is prime, it appends it to the `primes` list.\n- Finally, it returns the `primes` list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the input list and m is the maximum value in the input list. This is because the `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), and it is called for each number in the input list.

The function should have a time complexity of O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the original list and m is the maximum value in the original list.\n\nAssistant: Here is a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_prime_numbers(numbers):\n    primes = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            primes.append(num)\n    return primes\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. If it is divisible by any number, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.\n- The `get_prime_numbers` function takes in a list of numbers and initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.\n- It then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.\n- For each number, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if it is prime.\n- If the number is prime, it appends it to the `primes` list.\n- Finally, it returns the `primes` list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the input list and m is the maximum value in the input list. This is because the `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), and it is called for each number in the input list.

The function should have a time complexity of O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the original list and m is the maximum value in the original list.\n\nAssistant: Here is a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_prime_numbers(numbers):\n    primes = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            primes.append(num)\n    return primes\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. If it is divisible by any number, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.\n- The `get_prime_numbers` function takes in a list of numbers and initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.\n- It then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.\n- For each number, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if it is prime.\n- If the number is prime, it appends it to the `primes` list.\n- Finally, it returns the `primes` list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the input list and m is the maximum value in the input list. This is because the `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), and it is called for each number in the input list.

The function should have a time complexity of O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the original list and m is the maximum value in the original list.\n\nAssistant: Here is a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_prime_numbers(numbers):\n    primes = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            primes.append(num)\n    return primes\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. If it is divisible by any number, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.\n- The `get_prime_numbers` function takes in a list of numbers and initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.\n- It then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.\n- For each number, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if it is prime.\n- If the number is prime, it appends it to the `primes` list.\n- Finally, it returns the `primes` list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the input list and m is the maximum value in the input list. This is because the `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), and it is called for each number in the input list.

If it is divisible by any number, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.\n- The `get_prime_numbers` function takes in a list of numbers and initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.\n- It then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.\n- For each number, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if it is prime.\n- If the number is prime, it appends it to the `primes` list.\n- Finally, it returns the `primes` list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the input list and m is the maximum value in the input list. This is because the `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), and it is called for each number in the input list.

The function should have a time complexity of O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the original list and m is the maximum value in the original list.\n\nAssistant: Here is a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_prime_numbers(numbers):\n    primes = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            primes.append(num)\n    return primes\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. If it is divisible by any number, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.\n- The `get_prime_numbers` function takes in a list of numbers and initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.\n- It then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.\n- For each number, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if it is prime.\n- If the number is prime, it appends it to the `primes` list.\n- Finally, it returns the `primes` list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the input list and m is the maximum value in the input list. This is because the `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), and it is called for each number in the input list.

The function should have a time complexity of O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the original list and m is the maximum value in the original list.\n\nAssistant: Here is a possible implementation of the function:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n < 2:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_prime_numbers(numbers):\n    primes = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if is_prime(num):\n            primes.append(num)\n    return primes\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The `is_prime` function checks if a number `n` is prime by iterating from 2 to the square root of `n` and checking if `n` is divisible by any number in that range. If it is divisible by any number, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.\n- The `get_prime_numbers` function takes in a list of numbers and initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers.\n- It then iterates over each number in the input list `numbers`.\n- For each number, it calls the `is_prime` function to check if it is prime.\n- If the number is prime, it appends it to the `primes` list.\n- Finally, it returns the `primes` list containing only the prime numbers from the original list.\n\nThe time complexity of this function is O(n\u221am), where n is the length of the input list and m is the maximum value in the input list. This is because the `is_prime` function has a time complexity of O(sqrt(n)), and it is called for each number in the input list.
