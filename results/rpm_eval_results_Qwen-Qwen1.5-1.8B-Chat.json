The missing shape type is not G, as it is already present in the pattern.\n5. The missing shape type is not H, as it is already present in the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the missing shape type in Row 3 is likely to be a different shape type that is not present in the pattern. Based on the given pattern, the possible shapes that could be missing are:\n\n- A (square)\n- B (rectangle)\n- C (triangle)\n- D (circle)\n- E (pentagon)\n- F (hexagon)\n- G (hexagon)\n- H (hexagon)\n\nTo determine the correct shape type for Row 3, we would need more information about the specific shape that is missing. If we have a specific shape in mind, we can use it as a reference to fill in the missing shape type in Row 3. For example, if we know that the missing shape is a square, we can fill in the missing shape type with \"A\" and the missing shape color with \"I\". If we know that the missing shape is a rectangle, we can fill in the missing shape type with \"B\" and the missing shape color with \"G\". If we know that the missing shape is a triangle, we can fill in the missing shape type with \"C\" and the missing shape color with \"H\". If we know that the missing shape is a circle, we can fill in the missing shape type with \"D\" and the missing shape color with \"G\". If we know that the missing shape is a pentagon, we can fill in the missing shape type with \"E\" and the missing shape color with \"H\". If we know that the missing shape is a hexagon, we can fill in the missing shape type with \"F\" and the missing shape color with \"H\". If we know that the missing shape is a hexagon, we can fill in the missing shape type with \"F\" and the missing shape color with \"H\".\n\nOnce we have determined the correct shape type for Row 3, we can fill in the missing shape type and shape color with the appropriate values. The final tuple for Row 3 would be:\n\nRow 3: (A, I), (B, G), (?, ?)\n\nNote that the \"?\" symbol represents the missing shape type, which could be any of the shapes listed above.
