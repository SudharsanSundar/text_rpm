The fifth element (shape texture) follows a cycle of 'M', 'N', 'O', and then repeats.\n\nUsing these rules, we can fill in the missing values for the final tuple of Row 3:\n\n(?,?,?,?,?)\n\nThe first element (shape type) is 'B', which is the same as the first element in Row 3.\nThe second element (inner shape count) is 'F', which is the same as the second element in Row 1.\nThe third element (inner shape type) is 'I', which is the same as the third element in Row 1.\nThe fourth element (inner shape color) is 'L', which is the next value in the cycle.\nThe fifth element (shape texture) is 'O', which is the next value in the cycle.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nThe final answer is: (B, D, I, L, O)", "extracted_answer": "(B, D, I, L, O)", "score": 1, "problem_characteristics": {"problem_abstraction": [[["A", "F", "H", "J", "O"], ["A", "F", "H", "L", "M"], ["A", "F", "H", "K", "N"]], [["C", "E", "G", "L", "N"], ["C", "E", "G", "K", "O"], ["C", "E", "G", "J", "M"]], [["B", "D", "I", "K", "M"], ["B", "D", "I", "J", "N"], ["B", "D", "I", "L", "O"]]], "attributes": ["shape_type", "inner_shape_count", "inner_shape_type", "inner_shape_color", "shape_texture"], "attribute_to_rule": {"shape_type": "constant", "inner_shape_count": "constant", "inner_shape_type": "constant", "inner_shape_color": "distribute_3", "shape_texture": "distribute_3"}, "attribute_to_values": {"shape_type": ["A", "B", "C"], "inner_shape_count": ["D", "E", "F"], "inner_shape_type": ["G", "H", "I"], "inner_shape_color": ["J", "K", "L"], "shape_texture": ["M", "N", "O"]}, "num_nonconstant_rules": 2}}
